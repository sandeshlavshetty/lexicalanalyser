A lexical analyzer, also known as a scanner, is the first stage of a compiler or interpreter in the process of processing source code. It plays a crucial role in breaking down the code into its fundamental building blocks, known as **tokens**.

Here's what a lexical analyzer does:

* **Scans the source code:** It reads the source code character by character, like a scanner scanning a document.
* **Identifies lexical units:** It groups characters together based on the language's grammar rules. These groups are called **lexemes**.
* **Classifies lexemes into tokens:** Each lexeme is assigned a specific type, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals (numbers, strings, etc.), and punctuation marks. These types are the **tokens**.
* **Handles whitespace and comments:** Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and comments are typically ignored by the lexical analyzer as they don't affect the program's logic.
* **Provides information for subsequent stages:** The identified tokens, along with their types and sometimes additional information, are passed on to the next stage of the compiler or interpreter, usually the syntax analyzer.
